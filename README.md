# Django tutorial project
This project was made following the [Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/pt-br/3.2/intro/tutorial01/). Besides the `mysite`, an app for polls (convenently called `polls`) is also available.

The purpose here is to learn about the Django core in practice, while giving my own twists to the project.
